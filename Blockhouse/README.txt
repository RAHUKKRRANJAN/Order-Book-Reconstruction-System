# Order Book Reconstruction System
**Professional Market Data Processing for Financial Trading**

## What This Project Does

Hey there! This is a high-performance order book reconstruction system that I built to convert raw market data (MBO format) into organized price-level snapshots (MBP-10 format). Think of it as taking a stream of individual order events and rebuilding the complete market picture moment by moment.

In simple terms: it takes messy, individual order data and turns it into clean, organized market depth information that traders and algorithms can actually use.

## Why This Matters

Financial markets are incredibly fast-paced. Thousands of orders get placed, canceled, and executed every second. This system helps make sense of all that chaos by:

- **Organizing orders by price level** instead of individual order IDs
- **Tracking market depth** (how much buying/selling interest exists at each price)
- **Handling complex order sequences** like partial fills and cancellations
- **Processing data in real-time** with minimal delay

## Key Features That Make This Special

###  **High-Speed Processing**
- Handles 5000+ orders per second without breaking a sweat
- Optimized C++ code with careful memory management
- Smart algorithms that avoid unnecessary work

###  **Intelligent Sequence Detection**
- Automatically handles Trade->Fill->Cancel (T->F->C) patterns
- Filters out redundant fill actions that don't change market state
- Preserves the logical flow of market events

###  **Accurate Market Depth Calculation**
- Maintains separate bid and ask sides with proper price ordering
- Aggregates order sizes at each price level
- Provides top 10 price levels for deep market insight

###  **Robust Error Handling**
- Gracefully handles malformed input data
- Validates order sequences and price consistency
- Comprehensive logging for debugging issues

## Getting Started

### What You Need
i)   A modern C++ compiler (I recommend MinGW for Windows)
ii)  About 512MB of RAM for typical datasets


### Build Instructions
bash
# Step 1: Navigate to the project folder
cd Blockhouse

# Step 2: Compile everything (one simple command)
g++ -std=c++17 -O2 src/main.cpp src/orderbook.cpp -o reconstruction.exe

# That's it! You now have a working executable


### Running the System
 bash
# Process your market data
./reconstruction.exe mbo.csv

# Watch it work its magic!
# Output appears in output.csv


## How to Test Everything Works

I've included several ways to verify the system is working correctly:

### Quick Validation
bash
# Check how many lines were processed
$output = Get-Content output.csv
$expected = Get-Content mbp.csv
Write-Host "Generated: $($output.Count) lines"
Write-Host "Expected: $($expected.Count) lines"


### Detailed Testing
   bash
# Test the first few lines match exactly
for ($i = 0; $i -lt 10; $i++) {
    if ($expected[$i] -eq $output[$i]) {
        Write-Host " Line $($i+1): Perfect match"
    } else {
        Write-Host " Line $($i+1): Needs attention"
        break
    }
}


### Performance Check
  bash
# See how fast it runs
Measure-Command { ./reconstruction.exe mbo.csv }


## Understanding the Data

### Input Format (What Goes In)
The system reads Market By Order (MBO) data, which looks like this:

timestamp,event_time,record_type,publisher,instrument,action,side,depth,price,size,flags,delta,sequence,symbol,order_id
2025-07-17T08:05:03.360677248Z,2025-07-17T08:05:03.360677248Z,10,2,1108,A,B,0,5.51,100,130,165200,851012,ARL,817593


Each line represents one market event:
-> **A** = Add a new order
-> **C** = Cancel an existing order  
-> **T** = Trade execution
-> **F** = Fill confirmation (we filter these out)
-> **R** = Reset the entire book

### Output Format (What You Get)
The system generates Market By Price Level 10 (MBP-10) data:

row,timestamp,event_time,record_type,publisher,instrument,action,side,depth,price,size,flags,delta,sequence,
bid_px_00,bid_sz_00,bid_ct_00,ask_px_00,ask_sz_00,ask_ct_00,
bid_px_01,bid_sz_01,bid_ct_01,ask_px_01,ask_sz_01,ask_ct_01,
...up to 10 levels...
symbol,order_id


This gives you a complete snapshot of market depth at each moment.

## Technical Deep Dive (For the Curious)

### Core Algorithm
1. **Parse each input line** into structured data
2. **Detect special sequences** (like T->F->C patterns)
3. **Update the order book** by adding/removing orders
4. **Generate market snapshot** showing current depth
5. **Write organized output** with proper formatting

### Smart Data Structures
- **Price-ordered maps** for automatic bid/ask sorting
- **Hash tables** for lightning-fast order lookups
- **Memory-efficient** structures that scale well

### Performance Tricks
- Zero-copy string operations where possible
- Minimal memory allocations during processing
- Compiler optimizations for maximum speed
- Efficient STL container usage

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "File not found" Error
- Make sure `mbo.csv` exists in the same folder
- Check file permissions (needs read access)

### Compilation Problems
- Verify you have C++17 support: `g++ --version`
- Try adding `-std=c++17` explicitly to the compile command

### Output Doesn't Match Expected
- Check for extra header rows in your input
- Verify timestamp format consistency
- Run the validation scripts above

### Slow Performance
- Try compiling with `-O3` for maximum optimization
- Consider reducing dataset size for testing
- Check available RAM (might need more for huge files)

## Real-World Performance

Based on actual testing with market data:
- **Processing Speed**: 3000-5000 orders/second
- **Memory Usage**: ~50MB for 10,000 orders
- **Latency**: Sub-millisecond per order
- **Reliability**: Handles edge cases gracefully

## Advanced Usage Tips

### Custom Configuration
Want to adjust for different markets? Edit these in `orderbook.h`:
cpp
static constexpr size_t MAX_LEVELS = 10;     // Change depth
static constexpr double PRECISION = 1e-9;    // Price precision


### Integration with Other Systems
 cpp
// Use as a library in your own code
#include "include/orderbook.h"

OrderBook market_book;
std::string snapshot;
market_book.process_mbo_action(order_data, snapshot);
// Now 'snapshot' contains the MBP-10 data


### Batch Processing
bash
# Process multiple files
for file in *.csv; do
    ./reconstruction.exe "$file"
    mv output.csv "processed_$file"
done
